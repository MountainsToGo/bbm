# Fix: Auto-Zoom for Completed Locations

## üêõ Issue
When auto-zoom was enabled, clicking on a completed (green ‚úì) location in the sidebar did not zoom to that location. Only uncompleted locations were clickable and zoomable.

## ‚úÖ Solution
Made all locations clickable, including completed ones, so users can zoom back to review any location they've already completed.

## üîß Changes Made to `learn.html`

### 1. Added New Variable (Line ~840)
```javascript
let highlightedLocationIndex = null; // Track which location to highlight (for viewing completed items)
```

### 2. Updated `drawMap()` Function (Lines ~1016-1036)
**Before:**
- Only highlighted the current location when auto-zoom was enabled

**After:**
- Highlights either the `highlightedLocationIndex` (for completed items) OR `currentIndex` (for current item)
- This allows viewing the red circle around any clicked location, even completed ones

```javascript
// Draw red highlight circle for current location if auto-zoom is enabled
// OR for any highlighted location (including completed ones that were clicked)
if (autoZoomEnabled) {
    const highlightIndex = highlightedLocationIndex !== null ? highlightedLocationIndex : currentIndex;
    if (highlightIndex < locations.length) {
        const loc = locations[highlightIndex];
        // ... draw red circles ...
    }
}
```

### 3. Updated `updateList()` Function (Lines ~1210-1273)

**Completed Items (Lines ~1220-1229):**
```javascript
if (completedIndices.has(index)) {
    // Completed (correctly answered) - NOW CLICKABLE to zoom/view
    item.classList.add('completed');
    item.innerHTML = `‚úì ${loc.name}`;
    item.style.cursor = 'pointer';
    item.onclick = function() {
        // Allow clicking completed items to zoom to them
        highlightedLocationIndex = index; // Set which location to highlight
        if (autoZoomEnabled) {
            zoomToLocation(index);
        }
        // Don't change currentIndex, just zoom to view
        drawMap();
    };
}
```

**Other Items:**
- Added `highlightedLocationIndex = null;` to reset when clicking skipped, current, or pending items
- This ensures the highlight returns to the current question when clicking non-completed items

## üéØ Behavior Now

### With Auto-Zoom ON:
1. **Click current location** ‚Üí Zooms to current, shows red circle
2. **Click skipped location** ‚Üí Jumps to that location, zooms, shows red circle
3. **Click any pending location** ‚Üí Jumps to that location, zooms, shows red circle
4. **Click completed (‚úì) location** ‚Üí Zooms to view it, shows red circle (doesn't change current question)

### With Auto-Zoom OFF:
- All locations are still clickable
- Completed items don't zoom but can still be selected
- Current progress is maintained

## üìä Benefits

‚úÖ **Review Completed Locations** - Users can go back and view where they correctly answered
‚úÖ **Better Learning** - Helps reinforce memory by revisiting completed locations
‚úÖ **Consistent UX** - All locations are now clickable, not just pending ones
‚úÖ **Smart Highlighting** - Red circle shows for both current question and viewed completed items
‚úÖ **Maintains Progress** - Viewing completed items doesn't change your current progress

## üß™ Testing

1. Start Practice Mode
2. Enable Auto-Zoom (toggle button)
3. Answer a location correctly (gets green ‚úì)
4. Click on that completed location in the list
5. **Expected:** Map zooms to that location and shows red circle around it
6. **Verified:** ‚úÖ Works as expected!
